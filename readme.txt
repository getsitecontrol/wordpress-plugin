- **Mobile responsiveness**: adjust widget appearance for various mobile devices manually and make sure your message looks clear and coherent on smaller screens.
- **A/B testing** – create up to 5 variations of the same widget and run a split test to find out which copy, creative, and call-to-action brings you higher ROI.
